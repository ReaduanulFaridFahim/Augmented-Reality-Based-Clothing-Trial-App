# Augmented-Reality-Based-Clothing-Trial-App

Revolutionizing the Online Shopping Experience

Developed an Augmented Reality (AR)-based clothing trial app that allows users to virtually try on clothes before purchasing, offering a seamless and interactive shopping experience. The app uses AR technology to overlay clothing on the user's body in real-time, helping customers make better purchase decisions and reducing returns.

Project Overview:
With the rise of online shopping, customers often face uncertainty about how clothes will fit them. This app leverages MediaPipe for body measurements and integrates AR to create a virtual fitting room. It allows users to try on clothes virtually using their mobile device's camera.

Key Features:
✔️ Real-Time Virtual Clothing Try-On – View clothes on your avatar in real-time
✔️ AR Integration – Uses smartphone cameras for an immersive experience
✔️ Body Measurement Detection – Powered by MediaPipe for accurate body metrics
✔️ Clothing Catalog – Wide selection of apparel to try on
✔️ Seamless User Interface – Easy-to-use design for a smooth shopping experience
✔️ Shopping Cart Integration – Directly purchase the items after trying them on

Tech Stack:
🔹 Frontend: React Native / Flutter for mobile app development
🔹 Backend: Python, Flask/Django for server-side logic
🔹 AR Technology: Unity, ARKit/ARCore, MediaPipe
🔹 Cloud Storage: Firebase for user data and apparel catalog

Future Enhancements:
🔹 AI-Based Style Suggestions – Personalized outfit recommendations based on user preferences
🔹 Social Sharing – Share virtual try-ons with friends for feedback
🔹 Expanded Catalog – More brands and clothing options for users to try on

This project enhances the online shopping experience by combining AR and body measurement technologies to help customers make informed decisions, ultimately improving their satisfaction and confidence in purchasing.
